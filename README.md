# Wolfenstein-Style 3D Game Engine

This is a basic 3D game engine inpired by the original 'Wolfenstein 3D' game. It uses rasterization with raycasting to produce a 3D-looking scene on a two-dimensional screen. 

## Features
- Raycasting: Rendering a 3D environment using 2D grid-based maps.
- Basic Lighting: Walls that are further away get darker to get a better feel for the 3D perspective.
- Simple Collision Detection
- Scene and Player Customization: Ability to change colours of the various elements in the scene along with customizing player speed.
- Mini-map: A mini-map to better help with navigation.
